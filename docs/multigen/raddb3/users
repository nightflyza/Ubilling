#
# 	Configuration file for the rlm_files module.
# 	Please see rlm_files(5) manpage for more information.
#
# 	This file contains authentication security and configuration
#	information for each user.  Accounting requests are NOT processed
#	through this file.  Instead, see 'accounting', in this directory.
#
#	The first field is the user's name and can be up to
#	253 characters in length.  This is followed (on the same line) with
#	the list of authentication requirements for that user.  This can
#	include password, comm server name, comm server port number, protocol
#	type (perhaps set by the "hints" file), and huntgroup name (set by
#	the "huntgroups" file).
#
#	If you are not sure why a particular reply is being sent by the
#	server, then run the server in debugging mode (radiusd -X), and
#	you will see which entries in this file are matched.
#
#	When an authentication request is received from the comm server,
#	these values are tested. Only the first match is used unless the
#	"Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes".
#
#	A special user named "DEFAULT" matches on all usernames.
#	You can have several DEFAULT entries. All entries are processed
#	in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
#	matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
#	the Fall-Through variable.
#
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the configuration values to be passed back to
#	the comm server to allow the initiation of a user session.
#	This can include things like the PPP configuration values
#	or the host to log the user onto.
#
#	You can include another `users' file with `$INCLUDE users.other'

#
#	For a list of RADIUS attributes, and links to their definitions,
#	see: http://www.freeradius.org/rfc/attributes.html
#
#	Entries below this point are examples included in the server for
#	educational purposes. They may be deleted from the deployed
#	configuration without impacting the operation of the server.
